## 📊 Technical Specifications

### Chipload Values (Research-Based)

All values optimized for **1/4" diameter, 2-flute bits at 18,000 RPM**:

| Material | Chipload (in/tooth) | Roughing Feed | Finishing Feed |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Plywood** | 0.0045 | 162 IPM | 108 IPM |
| **Softwood** | 0.0050 | 180 IPM* | 108 IPM |
| **Hardwood** | 0.0042 | 151 IPM | 108 IPM |
| **MDF** | 0.0055 | 198 IPM* | 126 IPM |
| **Acrylic** | 0.0030 | 108 IPM | 72 IPM |

*\*Marked as "Aggressive" - suitable for experienced users*

### Safety Parameters

| Parameter | Formula | Cap | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-----|-------|
| **Feed Rate** | RPM × Flutes × Chipload | 200 IPM | Rounded to nearest 0 or 5, capped for safety |
| **Plunge Rate** | Feed × 0.5 | None | 50% of feed rate, rounded to nearest 0 or 5 |
| **Depth per Pass** | Bit Diameter × Material Factor | Varies | Typically 0.125" for 1/4" bit in hardwood |
| **Stepover** | Operation-dependent | 50% max | 40-50% roughing, 10-15% finishing |

### Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Hardwood Pocketing**
- Material: Hardwood (Cherry)
- Bit: RU2075 (1/4" upcut spiral)
- Operation: Pocketing
- RPM: 18,000

**Results:**
- Feed Rate: 140 IPM (rounded to nearest 5)
- Plunge Rate: 70 IPM (50% of feed rate)
- Depth per Pass: 0.125"
- Stepover: 45%

**Example 2: MDF Roughing**
- Material: MDF
- Bit: RU2075 (1/4" upcut spiral)
- Operation: Roughing
- RPM: 18,000

**Results:**
- Feed Rate: 200 IPM (capped at max, marked aggressive)
- Plunge Rate: 100 IPM (50% of feed rate)
- Depth per Pass: 0.188"
- Stepover: 45%

## 📐 Formulas Used

### Feed Rate
```
Feed Rate (IPM) = RPM × Number of Flutes × Chipload
(Rounded to nearest 0 or 5)
```

### Plunge Rate
```
Plunge Rate (IPM) = Feed Rate × 0.5
(50% of feed rate, rounded to nearest 0 or 5)
```

### Depth per Pass
```
Depth per Pass = Bit Diameter × Material Factor
```
Material factors range from 0.2 to 1.0 depending on hardness and operation type.

### Stepover Percentage
```
Roughing: 40-50% of bit diameter
Finishing: 10-15% of bit diameter
Pocketing: 40-50% of bit diameter
Profiling: 100% (full width)
```

## ⚠️ Safety Guidelines

**Always follow these safety practices:**

1. ✅ **Make test cuts** in scrap material before cutting final pieces
2. ✅ **Start conservative** (130-150 IPM range) and increase gradually
3. ✅ **Listen for changes** in motor sound (squealing = too slow, harsh grinding = too fast)
4. ✅ **Watch for burning** - indicates feed too slow or RPM too high
5. ✅ **Check for chatter** - indicates feed too fast or insufficient rigidity
6. ✅ **Inspect bits regularly** - dull bits require slower feeds
7. ✅ **Secure workpieces properly** - use vacuum, clamps, or tabs
8. ✅ **Clear chips frequently** - packed chips cause heat and poor cuts

**When to reduce feeds/speeds:**
- Material is harder than expected
- Bit is becoming dull
- Surface finish is poor
- Machine vibration increases
- Burning or melting occurs
- Loud chattering or squealing

**When you can increase feeds/speeds:**
- Clean cuts with good chip formation
- No burning or discoloration
- Smooth machine operation
- Good surface finish
- Experienced operator
